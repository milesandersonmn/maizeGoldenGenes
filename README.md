# maizeGoldenGenes
Basic statement: Attempt to identify syntenic gene models in 4 maize reference genomes with high evidentiary support.

Description: This is an independent project to attempt to verify the accuracy of a completed annotation pipeline I created for an internship. The annotation pipeline used a candidate gene approach, taking canonical transcripts from the maize reference genome B73_RefGen.V4 and annotating 8 founder parents in a MAGIC breeding population at the TUM chair for plant breeding using GenomeThreader. I was interested in further developing the pipeline and verifying its accuracy by curating a set of maize genes from reference quality genome assemblies that were annotated with high concordance to transcript evidence. Curating a list of genes for each reference genome with low annotation editing distance and 100% of splice sites confirmed through mRNA-seq alignment, followed by identifying syntenic blocks containing a high quality annotation in all 4 genomes would allow assessment of the pipeline with greater certainty.
